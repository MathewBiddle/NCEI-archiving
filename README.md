# NCEI-archiving
Code, documetation and issue tracking for NANOOS NCEI archiving

Refer to the excellent NCEI IOOS archiving cookbook documentation: [Archiving your data at NCEI - A Guide for IOOS Regional Association Data Managers](https://sites.google.com/a/noaa.gov/ncei-ioos-archive/cookbook/data-integrity)


## Other NANOOS or NANOOS-related data archived on NCEI

In addition to the formal data archiving process we are setting up, which will follow the IOOS-NCEI "gold standard" and will be done in coordination with NANOOS DMAC, other data packages may have been archived already at NCEI with a keyword linkage or acknowledgment to NANOOS. [This "NANOOS" search](http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/geoportal/rest/find/document?searchText=%22NANOOS%22&start=1&max=250&contentOption=intersecting&f=searchPage) to the [NCEI Geoportal](http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/geoportal/) returns all current NCEI records matching a NANOOS string.
- Currently (2016-12-7), there is one record there: [Dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, phosphate, silicate, and other variables collected from profile and discrete sample observations using CTD, Niskin bottle and other instruments in the northwest coast of the United States near the Cha Ba mooring off La Push, Washington from 2011-05-22 to 2014-10-24 (NCEI Accession 0145160)](http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.nodc:0145160). It looks like it was [submitted March 2016](ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/nodc/archive/arc0099/0145160/1.1/about/0-email.txt), but may have been updated in early Nov 2016. Data files are in Excel and csv formats.
- Note that Glider DAC data are not returned! Neither CMOP gliders, nor the CeNCOOS-NANOOS glider, both of which have been submitted to the Glider DAC

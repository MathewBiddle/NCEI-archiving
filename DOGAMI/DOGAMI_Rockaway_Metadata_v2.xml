      <abstract>This report describes and documents the Oregon Beach and Shoreline Mapping Analysis Program (OBSMAP) maintained by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI), with funding from the Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing System. The objective of this monitoring program is to document the response of Oregon’s beaches to both short-term climate variability (e.g., El Niños, extreme storms) and longer-term effects associated with the changing climate of the earth (e.g., increasing wave heights, changes to storm tracks, and sea level rise), that will influence the stability or instability of Oregon’s beaches over the next century. Understanding the wide range of responses characteristic of the Oregon coast is critical for effectively managing the public beach both today and into the future. Beach monitoring undertaken as part of the OBSMAP effort is based on repeated high-accuracy surveys of selected beach profiles using a Trimble R7/R8 Real-Time Kinematic Differential Global Positioning System (RTK-DGPS) mounted on either a backpack or on an ATV vehicle. The OBSMAP monitoring network currently consists of 211 beach monitoring sites, which include: 6 sites along the Clatsop Plains (Seaside to the mouth of the Columbia River). Monitored seasonally; 25 sites along the Rockaway littoral cell (Cape Meares to Neahkahnie Mountain). Monitored seasonally; 24 sites in the Netarts cell (Cape Lookout to Oceanside). Monitoring dependent on time and funding; 15 sites in the Neskowin cell (Cascade Head to Cape Kiwanda). Monitored seasonally; 33 sites along Gleneden Beach/Siletz Spit (Fishing Rock to Siletz Bay). Monitoring dependent on time and funding; 15 sites in the Beverly Beach cell (Yaquina Head to Otter Rock). Monitoring dependent on time and funding; 58 sites in the Newport littoral cell (Yachats to Yaquina Head). Monitoring dependent on time and funding; 35 sites in the Gold Beach littoral cell (Cape Sebastian to Sisters Rock). Monitoring dependent on time and funding.</abstract>

        <horizpar>The R7/R8 GPS system used has horizontal errors of approximately ±1 cm + 1 ppm (parts per million × the baseline length) and a vertical error of ±2 cm (Trimble Navigation Limited, 2009). Errors may be compounded by other factors such as poor satellite geometry, multipath, and poor atmospheric conditions, combining to increase the total error to several centimeters. DOGAMI uses a site calibration process in order to minimize such uncertainties. Once the local site calibration is completed, cross-shore beach profiles are surveyed with the R8 GPS rover unit mounted on a backpack; surveys are typically undertaken during low tide. The approach generally adopted involves walking from the landward edge of the primary dune, over the dune crest, down the beach face, and out into the ocean to approximately wading depth. A straight line perpendicular to the shore is achieved by navigating along a predetermined line displayed on a hand-held Trimble TSC2 computer connected to the R8 rover; RTK-DGPS corrections are provided by an R7 GPS base station located on an established benchmark. The computer shows the position of the operator relative to the survey line and indicates the deviation of the GPS operator from the line. The horizontal variability during and between subsequent surveys is generally minor, approximately 1 m (i.e., about ±0.5 m either side of the line) and, typically, results in negligible vertical uncertainties due to the wide, gently sloping beaches characteristic of much of the Oregon coast. This method can reliably detect elevation changes on the order of 4-5 cm, that is, well below normal seasonal changes in beach elevation, which typically varies by 1–2 m.</horizpar>
